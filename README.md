# database-management

In this SQL database project, I demonstrate my proficiency in database design and management. I created normalized tables, enforced referential integrity through foreign key constraints, and managed complex relationships between entities. Utilizing SQL for data definition and manipulation, I designed schemas, inserted data, and performed advanced joins to extract meaningful insights.

I applied best practices in database management by ensuring data consistency with primary keys and foreign keys, and handling potential data issues with drop statements for tables and databases. My skills in creating and managing relational databases are showcased through the careful design of tables for designers, customers, tailoring technicians, outfits, and fashion shows, as well as the relationships among them. This project highlights my ability to effectively structure and manage data in a SQL environment.
